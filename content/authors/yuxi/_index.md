Yuxi is a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Min-Yen Kan. She is visiting University of California, Santa Barbara and collaborates with Prof. William Wang in 2024. Her primary research focus is on Vision-Language Understanding and Reasoning. Prior to that, She worked with Prof. Yansong Feng at Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology at Peking University.

Her primary research focus is on Vision-Language Understanding and Reasoning. She is working on developing training and inference-time algorithms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large foundation models, including both LVLMs and LLMs. She has also been interested in Natural Language Generation, especially about generating deep questions that require complex reasoning on textual and multimodal data.
