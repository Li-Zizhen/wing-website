Yisong is a fourth-year PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Min-Yen Kan. His research interests include discourse and lexical semantics. He [composes emojis](https://yisong.me/publications/ELCo@LREC-COLING24.pdf) to represent lexical compositions and [asks questions](https://yisong.me/publications/acl24-DiSQ-CR.pdf) to evaluate language models' faithful understanding of discourse relations.
