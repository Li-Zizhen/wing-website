abstract: "Recommender systems are embracing conversational technologies to obtain
  user preferences dynamically, and to overcome inherent limitations of their static
  models. A successful Conversational Recommender System (CRS) requires proper handling
  of interactions between conversation and recommendation. We argue that three fundamental
  problems need to be solved: 1) what questions to ask regarding item attributes,
  2) when to recommend items, and 3) how to adapt to the users' online feedback. To
  the best of our knowledge, there lacks a unified framework that addresses these
  problems. In this work, we fill this missing interaction framework gap by proposing
  a new CRS framework named Estimation\\\"Action\\\" Reflection, or EAR, which consists
  of three stages to better converse with users. (1) Estimation, which builds predictive
  models to estimate user preference on both items and item attributes; (2) Action,
  which learns a dialogue policy to determine whether to ask attributes or recommend
  items, based on Estimation stage and conversation history; and (3) Reflection, which
  updates the recommender model when a user rejects the recommendations made by the
  Action stage. We present two conversation scenarios on binary and enumerated questions,
  and conduct extensive experiments on two datasets from Yelp and LastFM, for each
  scenario, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
  the state-of-the-art method CRM [32], corresponding to fewer conversation turns
  and a higher level of recommendation hits."
