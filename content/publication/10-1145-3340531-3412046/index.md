abstract: We propose Factual News Graph (FANG), a novel graphical social context representation
  and learning framework for fake news detection. Unlike previous contextual models
  that have targeted performance, our focus is on representation learning. Compared
  to transductive models, FANG is scalable in training as it does not have to maintain
  all nodes, and it is efficient at inference time, without the need to re-process
  the entire graph. Our experimental results show that FANG is better at capturing
  the social context into a high fidelity representation, compared to recent graphical
  and non-graphical models. In particular, FANG yields significant improvements for
  the task of fake news detection, and it is robust in the case of limited training
  data. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by FANG generalize
  to related tasks, such as predicting the factuality of reporting of a news medium.
