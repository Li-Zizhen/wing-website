abstract: When users seek to find specific resources in a digital library, they often
  use the library catalog to locate them. These catalog queries are defined as known
  item queries. As known item queries search for specific resources, it is important
  to manage them differently from other search types, such as area searches. We study
  how to identify known item queries in the context of a large academic institution's
  online public access catalog (OPAC), in which queries are issued via a simple keyword
  interface. We also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved
  the item in question. Our approach combines techniques in machine learning, language
  modeling and machine translation evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable
  of distinguishing known item queries and correctly classifies titles for whether
  they are the known item sought with an 80% and 95% correlation to human performance,
  respectively on each task. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such work,
  which has the potential to streamline the user interface of both OPACs and digital
  libraries in support of known item searches.
