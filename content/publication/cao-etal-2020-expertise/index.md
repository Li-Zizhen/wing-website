abstract: The curse of knowledge can impede communication between experts and laymen.
  We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated
  dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases. Solving this task not
  only simplifies the professional language, but also improves the accuracy and expertise
  level of laymen descriptions using simple words. This is a challenging task, unaddressed
  in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order
  to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We
  establish the benchmark performance of five state-of-the-art models for style transfer
  and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine
  and human performance. We also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation, to
  provide insights into future research directions. The dataset is publicly available
  at rÌ†lhttps://srhthu.github.io/expertise-style-transfer/.
