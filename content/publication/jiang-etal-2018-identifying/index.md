abstract: Identifying emergent research trends is a key issue for both primary researchers
  as well as secondary research managers. Such processes can uncover the historical
  development of an area, and yield insight on developing topics. We propose an embedded
  trend detection framework for this task which incorporates our bijunctive hypothesis
  that important phrases are written by important authors within a field and vice
  versa. By ranking both author and phrase information in a multigraph, our method
  jointly determines key phrases and authoritative authors. We represent this intermediate
  output as phrasal embeddings, and feed this to a recurrent neural network (RNN)
  to compute trend scores that identify research trends. Over two large datasets of
  scientific articles, we demonstrate that our approach successfully detects past
  trends from the field, outperforming baselines based solely on text centrality or
  citation.
