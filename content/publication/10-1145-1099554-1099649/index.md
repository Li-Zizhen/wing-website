abstract: We demonstrate the usefulness of the uniform resource locator (URL) alone
  in performing web page classification. This approach is faster than typical web
  page classification, as the pages do not have to be fetched and analyzed. Our approach
  segments the URL into meaningful chunks and adds component, sequential and orthographic
  features to model salient patterns. The resulting features are used in supervised
  maximum entropy modeling. We analyze our approach's effectiveness on two standardized
  domains. Our results show that in certain scenarios, URL-based methods approach
  the performance of current state-of-the-art full-text and link-based methods.
