abstract: When a variety of names are used for the same real-world entity, the problem
  of detecting all such variants has been known as the (record) linkage or entity
  resolution problem. In this paper, toward this problem, we propose a novel approach
  that uses the Web as the collective knowledge source in addition to contents of
  entities. Our hypothesis is that if an entity e1 is a duplicate of another entity
  e2, and if e1 frequently appears together with information I on the Web, then e2
  may appear frequently with I on the Web. By using search engines, we analyze the
  frequency, URLs, or contents of the returned web pages to capture the information
  I of an entity. Extensive experiments verify that our hypothesis holds in many real
  settings, and the idea of using the Web as the additional source for the linkage
  problem is promising. Our proposal shows 51% (on average) and 193% (at best) improvement
  in precision/recall compared to a baseline approach.
