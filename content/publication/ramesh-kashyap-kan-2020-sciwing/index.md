abstract: We introduce SciWING, an open-source soft-ware toolkit which provides access
  to state-of-the-art pre-trained models for scientific document processing (SDP)
  tasks, such as citation string parsing, logical structure recovery and citation
  intent classification. Compared to other toolkits, SciWING follows a full neural
  pipeline and provides a Python inter-face for SDP. When needed, SciWING provides
  fine-grained control for rapid experimentation with different models by swapping
  and stacking different modules. Transfer learning from general and scientific documents
  specific pre-trained transformers (i.e., BERT, SciBERT, etc.) can be performed.
  SciWING incorporates ready-to-use web and terminal-based applications and demonstrations
  to aid adoption and development. The toolkit is available from r̆lhttp://sciwing.io
  and the demos are available at l̆http://rebrand.ly/sciwing-demo.
