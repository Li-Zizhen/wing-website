abstract: We study how users of multiple online social networks (OSNs) employ and
  share information by studying a common user pool that use six OSNs -- Flickr, Google+,
  Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube. We analyze the temporal and topical signature
  of users' sharing behaviour, showing how they exhibit distinct behaviorial patterns
  on different networks. We also examine cross-sharing (i.e., the act of user broadcasting
  their activity to multiple OSNs near-simultaneously), a previously-unstudied behaviour
  and demonstrate how certain OSNs play the roles of originating source and destination
  sinks.
