abstract: Personal digital photo libraries embody a large amount of information useful
  for research into photo organization, photo layout, and development of novel photo
  browser features. Even when anonymity can be ensured, amassing a sizable dataset
  from these libraries is still difficult due to the visibility and cost that would
  be required from such a study.We explore using the Mac App Store to reach more users
  to collect data from such personal digital photo libraries. More specifically, we
  compare and discuss how it differs from common data collection methods, e.g. Amazon
  Mechanical Turk, in terms of time, cost, quantity, and design of the data collection
  application.We have collected a large, openly available photo feature dataset using
  this manner. We illustrate the types of data that can be collected. In 60 days,
  we collected data from 20,778 photo sets (473,772 photos). Our study with the Mac
  App Store suggests that popular application distribution channels is a viable means
  to acquire massive data collections for researchers.
