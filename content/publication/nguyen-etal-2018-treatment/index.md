abstract: With Health 2.0, patients and caregivers increasingly seek information regarding
  possible drug side effects during their medical treatments in online health communities.
  These are helpful platforms for non-professional medical opinions, yet pose risk
  of being unreliable in quality and insufficient in quantity to cover the wide range
  of potential drug reactions. Existing approaches which analyze such user-generated
  content in online forums heavily rely on feature engineering of both documents and
  users, and often overlook the relationships between posts within a common discussion
  thread. Inspired by recent advancements, we propose a neural architecture that models
  the textual content of user-generated documents and user experiences in online communities
  to predict side effects during treatment. Experimental results show that our proposed
  architecture outperforms baseline models.
