abstract: 'Automatic transfer of text between domains has become popular in recent
  times. One of its aims is to preserve the semantic content while adapting to the
  target domain. However, it does not explicitly maintain other attributes between
  the source and translated text: e.g., text length and descriptiveness. Maintaining
  constraints in transfer has several downstream applications, including data augmentation
  and debiasing. We introduce a method for such constrained unsupervised text style
  transfer by introducing two complementary losses to the generative adversarial network
  (GAN) family of models. Unlike the competing losses used in GANs, we introduce cooperative
  losses where the discriminator and the generator cooperate and reduce the same loss.
  The first is a contrastive loss and the second is a classification loss --- aiming
  to regularize the latent space further and bring similar sentences closer together.
  We demonstrate that such training retains lexical, syntactic and domain-specific
  constraints between domains for multiple benchmark datasets, including ones where
  more than one attribute change. We show that the complementary cooperative losses
  improve text quality, according to both automated and human evaluation measures.'
