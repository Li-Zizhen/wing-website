 abstract = {Uniform resource locators (URLs), which mark the address of a resource on the World Wide Web, are often human-readable and can hint at the category of the resource. This paper explores the use of URLs for webpage categorization via a two-phase pipeline of word segmentation/expansion and classification. We quantify its performance against document-based methods, which require the retrieval of the source document.},
