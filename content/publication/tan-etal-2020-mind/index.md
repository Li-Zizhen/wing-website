abstract: Inflectional variation is a common feature of World Englishes such as Colloquial
  Singapore English and African American Vernacular English. Although comprehension
  by human readers is usually unimpaired by non-standard inflections, current NLP
  systems are not yet robust. We propose Base-Inflection Encoding (BITE), a method
  to tokenize English text by reducing inflected words to their base forms before
  reinjecting the grammatical information as special symbols. Fine-tuning pretrained
  NLP models for downstream tasks using our encoding defends against inflectional
  adversaries while maintaining performance on clean data. Models using BITE generalize
  better to dialects with non-standard inflections without explicit training and translation
  models converge faster when trained with BITE. Finally, we show that our encoding
  improves the vocabulary efficiency of popular data-driven subword tokenizers. Since
  there has been no prior work on quantitatively evaluating vocabulary efficiency,
  we propose metrics to do so.
