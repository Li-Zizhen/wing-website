abstract: 'State-of-the-art question answering (QA) systems employ term-density ranking
  to retrieve answer passages. Such methods often retrieve incorrect passages as relationships
  among question terms are not considered. Previous studies attempted to address this
  problem by matching dependency relations between questions and answers. They used
  strict matching, which fails when semantically equivalent relationships are phrased
  differently. We propose fuzzy relation matching based on statistical models. We
  present two methods for learning relation mapping scores from past QA pairs: one
  based on mutual information and the other on expectation maximization. Experimental
  results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art density-based
  passage retrieval methods by up to 78% in mean reciprocal rank. Relation matching
  also brings about a 50% improvement in a system enhanced by query expansion.'
