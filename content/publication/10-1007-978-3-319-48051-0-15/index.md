abstract: Among several traditional and novel mobile app recommender techniques that
  utilize a diverse set of app-related features (such as an app’s Twitter followers,
  various version instances, etc.), which app-related features are the most important
  indicators for app recommendation? In this paper, we develop a hybrid app recommender
  framework that integrates a variety of app-related features and recommendation techniques,
  and then identify the most important indicators for the app recommendation task.
  Our results reveal an interesting correlation with data from third-party app analytics
  companies; and suggest that, in the context of mobile app recommendation, more focus
  could be placed in user and trend analysis via social networks.
