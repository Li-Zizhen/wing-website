abstract: We model productsâ€² reviews to generate comparative responses consisting
  of positive and negative experiences regarding the product. Specifically, we generate
  a single-sentence, comparative response from a given positive and a negative opinion.
  We contribute the first dataset for this task of Comparative Snippet Generation
  from contrasting opinions regarding a product, and an analysis of performance of
  a pre-trained BERT model to generate such snippets.
