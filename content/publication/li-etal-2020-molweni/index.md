abstract: 'Research into the area of multiparty dialog has grown considerably over
  recent years. We present the Molweni dataset, a machine reading comprehension (MRC)
  dataset with discourse structure built over multiparty dialog. Molweni′s source
  samples from the Ubuntu Chat Corpus, including 10,000 dialogs comprising 88,303
  utterances. We annotate 30,066 questions on this corpus, including both answerable
  and unanswerable questions. Molweni also uniquely contributes discourse dependency
  annotations in a modified Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT; Asher
  et al., 2016) style for all of its multiparty dialogs, contributing large-scale
  (78,245 annotated discourse relations) data to bear on the task of multiparty dialog
  discourse parsing. Our experiments show that Molweni is a challenging dataset for
  current MRC models: BERT-wwm, a current, strong SQuAD 2.0 performer, achieves only
  67.7% F1 on Molweni′s questions, a 20+% significant drop as compared against its
  SQuAD 2.0 performance.'
