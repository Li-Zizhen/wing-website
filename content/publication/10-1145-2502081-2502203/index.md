abstract: Social media platforms now allow users to share images alongside their textual
  posts. These image tweets make up a fast-growing percentage of tweets, but have
  not been studied in depth unlike their text-only counterparts. We study a large
  corpus of image tweets in order to uncover what people post about and the correlation
  between the tweet's image and its text. We show that an important functional distinction
  is between visually-relevant and visually-irrelevant tweets, and that we can successfully
  build an automated classifier utilizing text, image and social context features
  to distinguish these two classes, obtaining a macro F1 of 70.5%.
