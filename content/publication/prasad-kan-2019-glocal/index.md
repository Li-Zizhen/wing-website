abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a class of spectral clustering techniques
  that leverage localized convolution filters to perform supervised classification
  directly on graphical structures. While such methods model nodesâ€² local pairwise
  importance, they lack the capability to model global importance relative to other
  nodes of the graph. This causes such models to miss critical information in tasks
  where global ranking is a key component for the task, such as in keyphrase extraction.
  We address this shortcoming by allowing the proper incorporation of global information
  into the GCN family of models through the use of scaled node weights. In the context
  of keyphrase extraction, incorporating global random walk scores obtained from TextRank
  boosts performance significantly. With our proposed method, we achieve state-of-the-art
  results, bettering a strong baseline by an absolute 2% increase in F1 score.
