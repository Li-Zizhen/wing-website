abstract: Logical structure recovery in scientific articles associates text with a
  semantic section of the article. Although previous work has disregarded the surrounding
  context of a line, we model this important information by employing line-level attention
  on top of a transformer-based scientific document processing pipeline. With the
  addition of loss function engineering and data augmentation techniques with semi-supervised
  learning, our method improves classification performance by 10% compared to a recent
  state-of-the-art model. Our parsimonious, text-only method achieves a performance
  comparable to that of other works that use rich document features such as font and
  spatial position, using less data without sacrificing performance, resulting in
  a lightweight training pipeline.
