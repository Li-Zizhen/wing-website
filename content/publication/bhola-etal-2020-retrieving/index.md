abstract: We introduce a deep learning model to learn the set of enumerated job skills
  associated with a job description. In our analysis of a large-scale government job
  portal mycareersfuture.sg, we observe that as much as 65% of job descriptions miss
  describing a significant number of relevant skills. Our model addresses this task
  from the perspective of an extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) problem, where
  descriptions are the evidence for the binary relevance of thousands of individual
  skills. Building upon the current state-of-the-art language modeling approaches
  such as BERT, we show our XMLC method improves on an existing baseline solution
  by over 9% and 7% absolute improvements in terms of recall and normalized discounted
  cumulative gain. We further show that our approach effectively addresses the missing
  skills problem, and helps in recovering relevant skills that were missed out in
  the job postings by taking into account the structured semantic representation of
  skills and their co-occurrences through a Correlation Aware Bootstrapping process.
  We further show that our approach, to ensure the BERT-XMLC model accounts for structured
  semantic representation of skills and their co-occurrences through a Correlation
  Aware Bootstrapping process, effectively addresses the missing skills problem, and
  helps in recovering relevant skills that were missed out in the job postings. To
  facilitate future research and replication of our work, we have made the dataset
  and the implementation of our model publicly available.
