abstract: We introduce ECHo (Event Causality Inference via Human-Centric Reasoning),
  a diagnostic dataset of event causality inference grounded in visio-linguistic social
  scenarios. ECHo employs real-world human-centric deductive information building
  on a television crime drama. ECHo requires the Theory-of-Mind (ToM) ability to understand
  and reason about social interactions based on multimodal information. Using ECHo,
  we propose a unified Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to assess the reasoning capability
  of current AI systems. Our ToM-enhanced CoT pipeline accommodates various large
  foundation models in both zero-shot and few-shot visio-linguistic reasoning. We
  use this framework to scrutinize recent large foundation models such as InstructGPT
  and MiniGPT-4 on three diagnostic human-centric tasks. Further analysis demonstrates
  ECHo as a challenging dataset to expose imperfections and inconsistencies in reasoning.
  Our data and code are publicly available at [https://github.com/YuxiXie/ECHo](https://github.com/YuxiXie/ECHo).
