abstract: Current scientific fact-checking benchmarks exhibit several shortcomings,
  such as biases arising from crowd-sourced claims and an over-reliance on text-based
  evidence. We present SCITAB, a challenging evaluation dataset consisting of 1.2K
  expert-verified scientific claims that 1) originate from authentic scientific publications
  and 2) require compositional reasoning for verification. The claims are paired with
  evidence-containing scientific tables annotated with labels. Through extensive evaluations,
  we demonstrate that SCITAB poses a significant challenge to state-of-the-art models,
  including table-based pretraining models and large language models. All models except
  GPT-4 achieved performance barely above random guessing. Popular prompting techniques,
  such as Chain-of-Thought, do not achieve much performance gains on SCITAB. Our analysis
  uncovers several unique challenges posed by SCITAB, including table grounding, claim
  ambiguity, and compositional reasoning. Our codes and data are publicly available
  at https://github.com/XinyuanLu00/SciTab.
