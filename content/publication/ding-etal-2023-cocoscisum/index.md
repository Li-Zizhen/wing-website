abstract: We present a novel toolkit for controlled summarization of scientific documents,
  designed for the specific needs of the scientific community. Our system generates
  summaries based on user preferences, adjusting key attributes specifically of length
  and keyword inclusion. A distinguishing feature is its ability to manage multiple
  attributes concurrently, demonstrating Compositional Controllability for Scientific
  Summarization (CocoSciSum). Benchmarked against the strong Flan-T5 baseline, CocoSciSum
  exhibits superior performance on both the quality of summaries generated and the
  control over single and multiple attributes. Moreover, CocoSciSum is a user-centric
  toolkit, supporting user preferences expressed in natural language instructions,
  and accommodating diverse input document formats. CocoSciSum is available on GitHub
  (https://github.com/WING-NUS/SciAssist/tree/CocoSciSum) with an introduction video
