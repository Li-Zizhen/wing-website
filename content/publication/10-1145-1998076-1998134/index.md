abstract: With product reviews growing in depth and becoming more numerous, it is
  growing challenge to acquire a comprehensive understanding of their contents, for
  both customers and product manufacturers. We built a system that automatically summarizes
  a large collection of product reviews to generate a concise summary. Importantly,
  our system not only extracts the review sentiments but also the underlying justification
  for their opinion. We solve this problem through a novel application of clustering
  and validate our approach through an empirical study, obtaining good performance
  as judged by F-measure (the harmonic mean of purity and inverse purity).
