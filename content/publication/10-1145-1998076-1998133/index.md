abstract: Serendipity occurs when one finds an interesting discovery while searching
  for something else. While search engines seek to report work relevant to a targeted
  query, recommendation engines are particularly well-suited for serendipitous recommendations
  as such processes do not need to fulfill a targeted query. Junior researchers can
  use such an engine to broaden their horizon and learn new areas, while senior researchers
  can discover interdisciplinary frontiers to apply integrative research. We adapt
  a state-of-the-art scholarly paper recommendation system's user profile construction
  to make use of information drawn from 1) dissimilar users and 2) co-authors to specifically
  target serendipitous recommendation.
