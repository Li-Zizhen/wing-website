 abstract = {Serendipity occurs when one finds an interesting discovery while searching for something else. While search engines seek to report work relevant to a targeted query, recommendation engines are particularly well-suited for serendipitous recommendations as such processes do not need to fulfill a targeted query. Junior researchers can use such an engine to broaden their horizon and learn new areas, while senior researchers can discover interdisciplinary frontiers to apply integrative research. We adapt a state-of-the-art scholarly paper recommendation system's user profile construction to make use of information drawn from 1) dissimilar users and 2) co-authors to specifically target serendipitous recommendation.},
