abstract: Patients turn to Online Health Communities not only for information on specific
  conditions but also for emotional support. Previous research has indicated that
  the progression of emotional status can be studied through the linguistic patterns
  of an individual′s posts. We analyze a real-world dataset from the Mental Health
  section of HealthBoards.com. Estimated from the word usages in their posts, we find
  that the emotional progress across patients vary widely. We study the problem of
  predicting a patient′s emotional status in the future from her past posts and we
  propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architecture to address it. We find
  that the future emotional status can be predicted with reasonable accuracy given
  her historical posts and participation features. Our evaluation results demonstrate
  the efficacy of our proposed architecture, by outperforming state-of-the-art approaches
  with over 0.13 reduction in Mean Absolute Error.
