 abstract = {As e-learning becomes increasingly popular in learning, it is necessary to evaluate students' perceptions on e-learning systems to enhance the quality of the systems. This paper describes a survey on a group of 451 students from a local university using edveNTUre, a proprietary e-learning system powered by Blackboard. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study aimed to investigate the factors leading to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and behavioural intention to use the e-learning system. This paper concludes with a discussion on the interaction design of e-learning systems from students' perspectives.},
