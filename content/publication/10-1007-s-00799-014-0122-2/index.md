abstract: To help generate relevant suggestions for researchers, recommendation systems
  have started to leverage the latent interests in the publication profiles of the
  researchers themselves. While using such a publication citation network has been
  shown to enhance performance, the network is often sparse, making recommendation
  difficult. To alleviate this sparsity, in our former work, we identified \"potential
  citation papers\" through the use of collaborative filtering. Also, as different
  logical sections of a paper have different significance, as a secondary contribution,
  we investigated which sections of papers can be leveraged to represent papers effectively.
  While this initial approach works well for researchers vested in a single discipline,
  it generates poor predictions for scientists who work on several different topics
  in the discipline (hereafter, \"intra-disciplinary\"). We thus extend our previous
  work in this paper by proposing an adaptive neighbor selection method to overcome
  this problem in our imputation-based collaborative filtering framework. On a publicly-available
  scholarly paper recommendation dataset, we show that recommendation accuracy significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines as measured by nDCG and MRR,
  when using our adaptive neighbor selection method. While recommendation performance
  is enhanced for all researchers, improvements are more marked for intra-disciplinary
  researchers, showing that our method does address the targeted audience.
