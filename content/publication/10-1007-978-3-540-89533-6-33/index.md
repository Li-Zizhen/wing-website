abstract: We present ForeCiteNote, an application that organizes personal digital
  collections of research articles. It is architected as a single HTML page with embedded
  Javascript that runs within a web browser. On top of standard annotation and tagging
  functionality, it also supports both online and offline usage patterns, including
  local storage of the paper collection.
