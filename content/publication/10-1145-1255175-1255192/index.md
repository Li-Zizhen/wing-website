abstract: 'Research findings are often transmitted both as written documents and narrated
  slide presentations. As these two forms of media contain both unique and replicated
  information, it is useful to combine and align these two views to create a single
  synchronized medium. We introduce SlideSeer, a digital library that discovers, aligns
  and presents such presentation and document pairs. We discuss the three major system
  components of the SlideSeer DL: 1) the resource discovery, 2) the fine-grained alignment
  and 3) the user interface. For resource discovery, we have bootstrapped our collection
  building process using metadata from DBLP and CiteSeer. For alignment, we modify
  maximum similarity alignment to favor monotonic alignments and incorporate a classifier
  to handle slides which should not be aligned. For the user interface, we allow the
  user to seamlessly switch between four carefully motivated views of the resulting
  synchronized media pairs.'
