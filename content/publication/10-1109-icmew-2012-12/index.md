abstract: A photo stream is a chronological sequence of photos. Most existing photo
  stream segmentation methods assume that a photo stream comprises of photos from
  multiple events and their goal is to produce groups of photos, each corresponding
  to an event, i.e. they perform automatic albuming. Even if these photos are grouped
  by event, sifting through the abundance of photos in each event is cumbersome. To
  help make photos of each event more manageable, we propose a photo stream segmentation
  method for an event photo stream--the chronological sequence of photos of a single
  event--to produce groups of photos, each corresponding to a photo-worthy moment
  in the event. Our method is based on a hidden Markov model with parameters learned
  from time, EXIF metadata, and visual information from 1) training data of unlabelled,
  unsegmented event photo streams and 2) the event photo stream we want to segment.
  In an experiment with over 5000 photos from 28 personal photo sets, our method outperformed
  all six baselines with statistical significance (p
