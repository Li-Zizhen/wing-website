abstract: A current application of automatic text summarization is to provide an overview
  of relevant documents coming from an information retrieval (IR) system. This paper
  examines how Centrifuser, one such summarization system, was designed with respect
  to methods used in the library community. We have reviewed these librarian expert
  techniques to assist information seekers and codified them into eight distinct strategies.
  We detail how we have operationalized six of these strategies in Centrifuser by
  computing an informative extract, indicative differences between documents, as well
  as navigational links to narrow or broaden a user's query. We conclude the paper
  with results from a preliminary evaluation.
