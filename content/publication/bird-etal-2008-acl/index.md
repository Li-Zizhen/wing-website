abstract: The ACL Anthology is a digital archive of conference and journal papers
  in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Its primary purpose
  is to serve as a reference repository of research results, but we believe that it
  can also be an object of study and a platform for research in its own right. We
  describe an enriched and standardized reference corpus derived from the ACL Anthology
  that can be used for research in scholarly document processing. This corpus, which
  we call the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ACL ARC), brings together the recent
  activities of a number of research groups around the world. Our goal is to make
  the corpus widely available, and to encourage other researchers to use it as a standard
  testbed for experiments in both bibliographic and bibliometric research.
