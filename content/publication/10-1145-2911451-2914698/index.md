abstract: Many organizations possess social media accounts on different social networks,
  but these profiles are not always linked. End applications, users, as well as the
  organization themselves, can benefit when the profiles are appropriately identified
  and linked. Most existing works on social network entity linking focus on linking
  individuals, and do not model features specific for organizational linking. We address
  this gap not only to link official social media accounts but also to discover and
  solve the identification and linking of associated affiliate accounts -- such as
  geographical divisions and brands -- which are important to distinguish.We instantiate
  our method for classifying profiles on social network services for Twitter and Facebook,
  which major organizations use. We classify profiles as to whether they belong to
  an organization or its affiliates. Our best classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.976
  on average in both datasets, significantly improving baselines that exploit the
  features used in state-of-the-art comparable user linkage strategies.
