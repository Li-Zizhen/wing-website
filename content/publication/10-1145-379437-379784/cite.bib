 abstract = {In this demonstration, we present several integrated components of PER SIVAL PErsonalized Retrieval and Summarization of Image, Video And anguage)[1], a system designed to provide personalized access to a distributed digital library of medical literature and consumer health information.  The global system architecture of PERSIVAL is best described as a two-stage processing pipeline.  The first stage is a retrieval system that matches user queries with relevant multimedia data in the library.  The second stage is a visualization system that processes the multimedia data matched by the first stage for display.Our demonstration focuses on the second stage of PERSIVAL's processing pipeline.  Given a set of relevant documents for certain predefined queries, our integrated demonstration seeks to give a tailored response for either physicians or patients, featuring textual summaries, as well as relevant medical definitions.  To visualize the summaries and definitions, we employ automated constraint-based layout of the user interface that allows for rich interaction between summaries and definitions.PERSIVAL's natural language processing and user interface modules make up the visualization portion of the system and illustrate state-of-the-art digital library technology.  Following are the modules presented in our demonstration.},
