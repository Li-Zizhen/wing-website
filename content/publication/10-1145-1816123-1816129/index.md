abstract: We examine the effect of modeling a researcher's past works in recommending
  scholarly papers to the researcher. Our hypothesis is that an author's published
  works constitute a clean signal of the latent interests of a researcher. A key part
  of our model is to enhance the profile derived directly from past works with information
  coming from the past works' referenced papers as well as papers that cite the work.
  In our experiments, we differentiate between junior researchers that have only published
  one paper and senior researchers that have multiple publications. We show that filtering
  these sources of information is advantageous -- when we additionally prune noisy
  citations, referenced papers and publication history, we achieve statistically significant
  higher levels of recommendation accuracy.
