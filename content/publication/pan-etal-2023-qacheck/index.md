abstract: 'Fact-checking real-world claims often requires intricate, multi-step reasoning
  due to the absence of direct evidence to support or refute them. However, existing
  fact-checking systems often lack transparency in their decision-making, making it
  challenging for users to comprehend their reasoning process. To address this, we
  propose the Question-guided Multi-hop Fact-Checking (QACheck) system, which guides
  the modelâ€²s reasoning process by asking a series of questions critical for verifying
  a claim. QACheck has five key modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a
  question-answering module, a QA validator, and a reasoner. Users can input a claim
  into QACheck, which then predicts its veracity and provides a comprehensive report
  detailing its reasoning process, guided by a sequence of (question, answer) pairs.
  QACheck also provides the source of evidence supporting each question, fostering
  a transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process.'
