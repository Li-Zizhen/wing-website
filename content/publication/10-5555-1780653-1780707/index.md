abstract: We present a keyphrase extraction algorithm for scientific publications.
  Different from previous work, we introduce features that capture the positions of
  phrases in document with respect to logical sections found in scientific discourse.
  We also introduce features that capture salient morphological phenomena found in
  scientific keyphrases, such as whether a candidate keyphrase is an acronyms or uses
  specific terminologically productive suffixes. We have implemented these features
  on top of a baseline feature set used by Kea [1]. In our evaluation using a corpus
  of 120 scientific publications multiply annotated for keyphrases, our system significantly
  outperformed Kea at the p < .05 level. As we know of no other existing multiply
  annotated keyphrase document collections, we have also made our evaluation corpus
  publicly available. We hope that this contribution will spur future comparative
  research.
