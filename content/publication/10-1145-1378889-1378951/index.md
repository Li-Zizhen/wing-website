abstract: We consider the task of automatic slide image retrieval, in which slide
  images are ranked for relevance against a textual query. Our implemented system,
  SLIDIR caters specifically for this task using features specifically designed for
  synthetic images embedded within slide presentation. We show promising results in
  both the ranking and binary relevance task and analyze the contribution of different
  features in the task performance.
