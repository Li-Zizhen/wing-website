abstract: We describe about the system description of the PSNUS team for the SemEval-2007
  Web People Search Task. The system is based on the clustering of the web pages by
  using a variety of features extracted and generated from the data provided. This
  system achieves Fα=0.5 = 0.75 and Fα=0.2 = 0.78 for the final test data set of the
  task.
