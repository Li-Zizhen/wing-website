abstract: Web pages often embed scripts for a variety of purposes, including advertising
  and dynamic interaction. Understanding embedded scripts and their purpose can often
  help to interpret or provide crucial information about the web page. We have developed
  a functionality-based categorization of JavaScript, the most widely used web page
  scripting language. We then view understanding embedded scripts as a text categorization
  problem. We show how traditional information retrieval methods can be augmented
  with the features distilled from the domain knowledge of JavaScript and software
  analysis to improve classification performance. We perform experiments on the standard
  WT10G web page corpus, and show that our techniques eliminate over 50% of errors
  over a standard text classification baseline.
