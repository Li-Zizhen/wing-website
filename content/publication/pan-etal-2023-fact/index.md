abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims often requires collecting multiple pieces
  of evidence and applying complex multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we present
  Program-Guided Fact-Checking (ProgramFC), a novel fact-checking model that decomposes
  complex claims into simpler sub-tasks that can be solved using a shared library
  of specialized functions. We first leverage the in-context learning ability of large
  language models to generate reasoning programs to guide the verification process.
  Afterward, we execute the program by delegating each sub-task to the corresponding
  sub-task handler. This process makes our model both explanatory and data-efficient,
  providing clear explanations of its reasoning process and requiring minimal training
  data. We evaluate ProgramFC on two challenging fact-checking datasets and show that
  it outperforms seven fact-checking baselines across different settings of evidence
  availability, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging. Our codes
  and data are publicly available at rÌ†lhttps://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/ProgramFC.
