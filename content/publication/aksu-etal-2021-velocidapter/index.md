abstract: We introduce a synthetic dialogue generation framework, Velocidapter, which
  addresses the corpus availability problem for dialogue comprehension. Velocidapter
  augments datasets by simulating synthetic conversations for a task-oriented dialogue
  domain, requiring a small amount of bootstrapping work for each new domain. We evaluate
  the efficacy of our framework on a task-oriented dialogue comprehension dataset,
  MRCWOZ, which we curate by annotating questions for slots in the restaurant, taxi,
  and hotel domains of the MultiWOZ 2.2 dataset (Zang et al., 2020). We run experiments
  within a low-resource setting, where we pretrain a model on SQuAD, fine-tuning it
  on either a small original data or on the synthetic data generated by our framework.
  Velocidapter shows significant improvements using both the transformer-based BERTBase
  and BiDAF as base models. We further show that the framework is easy to use by novice
  users and conclude that Velocidapter can greatly help training over task-oriented
  dialogues, especially for low-resourced emerging domains.
