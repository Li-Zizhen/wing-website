abstract: We present a new algorithm to measure domain-specific readability. It iteratively
  computes the readability of domain-specific resources based on the difficulty of
  domain-specific concepts and vice versa, in a style reminiscent of other bipartite
  graph algorithms such as Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and the Stochastic
  Approach for Link-Structure Analysis (SALSA). While simple, our algorithm outperforms
  standard heuristic measures and remains competitive among supervised-learning approaches.
  Moreover, it is less domain-dependent and portable across domains as it does not
  rely on an annotated corpus or expensive expert knowledge that supervised or domain-specific
  methods require.
