 abstract = {We present a new algorithm to measure domain-specific readability. It iteratively computes the readability of domain-specific resources based on the difficulty of domain-specific concepts and vice versa, in a style reminiscent of other bipartite graph algorithms such as Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and the Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis (SALSA). While simple, our algorithm outperforms standard heuristic measures and remains competitive among supervised-learning approaches. Moreover, it is less domain-dependent and portable across domains as it does not rely on an annotated corpus or expensive expert knowledge that supervised or domain-specific methods require.},
