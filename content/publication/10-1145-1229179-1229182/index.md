abstract: 'We explore probabilistic lexico-syntactic pattern matching, also known
  as soft pattern matching, in a definitional question answering system. Most current
  systems use regular expression-based hard matching patterns to identify definition
  sentences. Such rigid surface matching often fares poorly when faced with language
  variations. We propose two soft matching models to address this problem: one based
  on bigrams and the other on the Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models
  provide a theoretically sound method to model pattern matching as a probabilistic
  process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We
  show that both models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art manually constructed
  hard matching patterns on recent TREC data.A critical difference between the two
  models is that the PHMM has a more complex topology. We experimentally show that
  the PHMM can handle language variations more effectively but requires more training
  data to converge.While we evaluate soft pattern models only on definitional question
  answering, we believe that both models are generic and can be extended to other
  areas where lexico-syntactic pattern matching can be applied.'
