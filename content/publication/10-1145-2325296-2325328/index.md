abstract: Existing source code plagiarism systems focus on the problem of identifying
  plagiarism between pairs of submissions. The task of detection, while essential,
  is only a small part of managing plagiarism in an instructional setting. Holistic
  plagiarism detection and management requires coordination and sharing of assignment
  similarity -- elevating plagiarism detection from pairwise similarity to cluster-based
  similarity; from a single assignment to a sequence of assignments in the same course,
  and even among instructors of different courses.To address these shortcomings, we
  have developed Student Submissions Integrity Diagnosis (SSID), an open-source system
  that provides holistic plagiarism detection in an instructor-centric way. SSID's
  visuals show overviews of plagiarism clusters throughout all assignments in a course
  as well as highlighting most-similar submissions on any specific student. SSID supports
  plagiarism detection workflows; e.g., allowing student assistants to flag suspicious
  assignments for later review and confirmation by an instructor with proper authority.
  Evidence is automatically entered into SSID's logs and shared among instructors.We
  have additionally collected a source code plagiarism corpus, which we employ to
  identify and correct shortcomings of previous plagiarism detection engines and to
  optimize parameter tuning for SSID deployment. Since its deployment, SSID's workflow
  enhancements have made plagiarism detection in our faculty less tedious and more
  successful.
