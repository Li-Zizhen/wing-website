abstract: This paper proposes the problem of Deep Question Generation (DQG), which
  aims to generate complex questions that require reasoning over multiple pieces of
  information about the input passage. In order to capture the global structure of
  the document and facilitate reasoning, we propose a novel framework that first constructs
  a semantic-level graph for the input document and then encodes the semantic graph
  by introducing an attention-based GGNN (Att-GGNN). Afterward, we fuse the document-level
  and graph-level representations to perform joint training of content selection and
  question decoding. On the HotpotQA deep-question centric dataset, our model greatly
  improves performance over questions requiring reasoning over multiple facts, leading
  to state-of-the-art performance. The code is publicly available at rÌ†lhttps://github.com/WING-NUS/SG-Deep-Question-Generation.
