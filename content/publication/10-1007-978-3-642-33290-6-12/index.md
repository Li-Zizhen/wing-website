  (PrEV) system, a city-centric multilingual digital library that archives and makes
  available Web 2.0 resources, and aims to store a comprehensive record of what urban
  lifestyle is like. To match the current state of the digital environment, a key
  architectural design choice in PrEV is to archive not only Web 1.0 web pages, but
  also Web 2.0 multilingual resources that include multimedia, real-time microblog
  content, as well as mobile application descriptions (e.g., iPhone app) in a collaborative
  manner. PrEV performs the preservation of such resources for posterity, and makes
  them available for programmatic retrieval by third party agents, and for exploration
  by scholars with its user interface.
