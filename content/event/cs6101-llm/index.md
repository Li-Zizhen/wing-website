summary: 'CS6101 in AY23/24 Semester I (2310) -Large Language Models'
abstract: 'WING.NUS’s CS6101 lab section will be conducted as a public course, with class participants nominating themselves and presenting the materials and leading the discussion. In Semester I of AY2023/2024, we will focus on the topics of Large Language Models (LLMs). This course is based on materials from Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto and Christopher Ré’s CS324 Large Language Models course at Stanford; Danqi Chen’s COS 597G Understanding Large Language Models course at Princeton; and Ryan Cotterell’s Large Language Models course at ETH. All three sets of instructors have given their explicit permission to allow us to re-use and build upon their fantastic resources. There will be 14 reading sessions, which will be held from 16:00 pm to 18:00 pm on Fridays. On alternate Thursdays, 13:00-15:00 pm, we will have project consultation sessions.'
