summary: 'The 2023 Singapore Symposium on Natural Language Processing'
abstract: 'We are pleased to announce that the Singapore Symposium on Natural Language Processing (SSNLP 2023) will be held on Monday, December 4 (full day). This is an annual Singapore-based pre-conference practice workshop for both local students, practitioners and faculty working in Natural Language Processing to network. It has been successfully held in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022, becoming an increasingly popular and impactful event.

We are further excited about the unique opportunity presented to Singapore on 6-10 December as the EMNLP 2023, a premier Computational Linguistics and NLP conference, is being held in Singapore. Leveraging the attendance of many reputed academicians, we’re looking forward to hosting them as a part of SSNLP – and, further, taking the opportunity to invite them to the School of Computing of National University of Singapore (NUS) to engage with us.

The venue will be held at the Shaw Foundation Alumni House Auditorium, NUS (11 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore 119244). We are planning a hybrid (onsite & online) format for SSNLP to ensure maximal outreach.'
