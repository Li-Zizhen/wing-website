title: Light Verb Constructions

summary: We investigate methods to identify light verb constructions (LVCs) from a corpus, as well as recognizing linguistic features of LVCs.
abstract: LVCs like "make a decision" and "give a presentation" are verb-complement pairs where the verb has minimal lexical meaning and the semantic content comes primarily from the complement. These constructions pose interesting challenges for natural language processing that we aim to address through computational analysis.

Project Duration: May 2004 - July 2005.

A light verb construction (LVC) is a verbâ€“complement pair in which the verb has little lexical meaning and much of the semantic content of the construction is obtained from the complement. Examples of LVCs are "make a decision" and "give a presentation", and these pose challenges for natural language processing and understanding. In this project, we investigate methods to identify LVCs from a corpus, as well as recognizing linguistic features of LVCs.
