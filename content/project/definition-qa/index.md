Joint work with PRIS group led by Prof. Tat-Seng Chua

We explore advanced techniques in definition question answering: soft pattern matching, and boosting of IR recall and precision of extended definition sentences using external web resources and historical query logs. We also explore the construction of fluent definitions using sentence understanding and re-synthesis.
